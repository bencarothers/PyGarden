##TwiPy Garden

A program written in python that monitors the specified twitter account looking
for tweets that contain the #waterMe and triggers a drip irrigation valve with
specified parameters by interfacing with the Open Sprinkler Pi

## Motivation

This program provides a lightweight, functional means of watering my garden with
simple and powerful commands. The service is also available from anywhere I can
access Twitter

## Installation and Running

The TwitterLogin class is not hosted on Github. The class is primarily used to create a Twitter API object, and then access it while keeping the login criteria private. Giving the class an api attribute in the init function would give you all the functionality necessary.

## Selected Libraries Used

**Python-Twitter API
