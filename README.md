##TwiPy Garden

A Python script that monitors a Twitter Timeline for #waterMe. 
If it finds the hashtag, it waters the garden for the specified number of minutes and deletes the tweet.

## Motivation

This program provides a lightweight, functional means of watering my garden with
simple and powerful commands. The service is also available from anywhere I can
access Twitter.

## Installation and Running

You'll need to fill in the TwitterLogin.py file with the appropriate keys and secrets so that the program will have access to the Twitter accounts timeline.

\#waterMe can be located anywhere in the tweet, but the positive integer must follow the hashtag with a single space in between the two.
